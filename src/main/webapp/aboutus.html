        An employee management system is a software or platform used by organizations to manage various aspects 
        of their employees' work, such as attendance tracking, performance monitoring, scheduling, payroll, and other related tasks. It provides a centralized system for HR departments to manage employee data and automate administrative tasks. The system helps companies ensure that employees are productive,
